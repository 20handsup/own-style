            <h1>A Style of His Own</h1>
            <h2>Jesus&mdash;Yes</h2>
            <p>
              It was only one of the many placards we saw wielded by the
              protestors of the sixties, but it arrested me. The sign simply
              said, "Jesus&mdash;yes! Christianity&mdash;no!"
            </p>
            <p>
              I pondered, "Why, through all these years, has the reality of
              Jesus remained innately attractive while our interpretations of
              him have proved less captivating?" Somewhere we have missed an
              understanding of him that portrays him properly. But, what? Could
              there be anything about im that we have not researched or
              developed? Is there a key? I share my search with you.
            </p>
            <p>
              The focal point of all time, all history, all study (my bias is
              evident) is the person of Jesus Christ. Yet, this book is not
              about the omniscience, omnipotence or omnipresence of Jesus, not
              about predestination or the foreknowledge of God. These traits, as
              I read them in systematic theologies and their treatment of his
              nature, place Jesus beyond my reach—sometimes, I think, safely so.
              What more can be said of his visual awesomeness than the word
              pictures in the first chapter of Revelation?
            </p>
            <p>
              Instead of these overwhelming, majestic descriptions with endless
              possibilities of theological convolutions, I want to speak of his
              incarnation. I want to take his thundering power, compress it into
              the body that was his, place your land against his skin and, if
              your mind can handle it (I know that your spirit can), let you
              know that the touch and the warmth you feel is God himself.
            </p>
            <p>
              When that first cry was heard from the stable of Bethlehem and
              into the care of Mary and Joseph came a wrinkled, blood-covered
              baby, the universe reached ins turning point. For the first time,
              the God and Creator who before had been only heard could now be
              seen and touched. All that he was now occupied human flesh…
              approachable, available, vulnerable. Yet, mankind prefers the
              unseen, distant God. We rather wrestle with principles, dogmas and
              ida than hear him call us to himself as a person.
            </p>
            <p>
              But God would not have it that way. Jesus, the dividing point of
              time, could be touched, and he put us in touch with God. It is
              appropriate that the records show him going everywhere touching
              people, even those who had been untouchable until that time.
              Ironically, the records also show that those he touched did not
              understand who he ws. Even his closest followers were often
              uncertain.
            </p>
            <h2><i>The Upside Down Kingdom</i></h2>
            <p>
              John the Baptist, Jesus’ own cousin, is an example of that
              uncertainty. Early in his ministry he said of Jesus: “This is the
              one!” Later, he asked, speaking out of his doubt, “Are you the
              one?”
            </p>
            <p>
              What happened in the meantime? Why did he get confused about who
              Jesus actually was? John gives us a clue to what might have been
              the source of his confusion. At the time he made the first
              statement, he revealed that he would not have known Jesus had it
              not been for the Spirit descending and remaining on him. In other
              words, there was nothing automatically messianic in his appearance
              (a difficult thing to believe when we look at the artistic
              portrayals of Jesus) nor did actions match the traditional
              expectations of the Messiah.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though John preached the message of preparation given to him, he,
              along with the disciples who were constantly asking Jesus when he
              was going to throw offRome and establish the kingdom, may well
              have harbored a traditional understanding of the Messiah. The
              question is, “How do we align our understanding with the truth?”
            </p>
            <p>
              The disciples repeatedly struggled with what Jesus was trying to
              teach them about the kingdom of God. The jockeyed for position,
              maneuvered for favor, argued over who was the greatest. I,
              frankly, appreciate seeing their humanness. Naturally, I consider
              myself too sophisticated today to stoop to such a crass approach.
              Instead, when I go into committee meeting, I scheme about how I
              can get the others to do what I want them to do while they think
              it is what they want to do and then, ultimately, to give me the
              credit. Or I join with others in clever political maneuverings
              behind the scenes at church conventions and remain conveniently
              blind to my own motivation.
